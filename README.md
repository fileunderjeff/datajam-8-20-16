My work from the Houston Data Viz data jam on 8-20-16. The dataset included 2016 US Presidential primary results broken down by candidate and county. The dataset also included a shapefile outlining every county in the US.

I was interested in isolating outsider candidates and seeing which Texas counties voted for them. I used Leaflet for mapping.
